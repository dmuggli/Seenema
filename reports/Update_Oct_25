2. Set up deadlines for the next submission
3. Division of pages to implement reviewed with Sahil (additions/subtractions as needed)
4. Determine file structure needed in Github and assign implementation

### Subsection 1:
Local host  environment set up still remaining
Production of Figmas
List UI needed for minimum viable product

### Subsection 2:
**Update (progress and issues):** 

- **What we did:**
  - Determine what will be in/out scope
  - Updating requirement document
  - Updated the flowchart based on the feedback
  - 

- **Insights:**
  - The requirement gathering and detail needed was surprising, but ultimately I think it will pay dividends
  - Learning about the CI/CD flow in lecture and the testing tools available will be very beneficial to leverage
  - 

### Subsection 3:

#### Back end goals for the upcoming week:
- Arrive at a point where we can begin coding this week
- Create the file structure in GitHub
- Set up local host environment
- Successful test of API integration with TMBD

#### Front end goals for the upcoming week:
- Ensure all assets are found and licensed for use (logos, thumbs, plus sign, profile silhouette, etc)
- Zero merge conflicts as we begin to submit individual workflows

**Contributions of individual team members:**

##### Long Term Focus/Goal:
- Quickly work through backend implementation so majority of tie can be spent on front end dev work
- User experience remains the focus and we take time to elicit feedback from outside sources
